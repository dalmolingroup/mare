    abstract = {The analysis of shotgun metagenomic data provides valuable insights into microbial communities, while allowing resolution at individual genome level. In absence of complete reference genomes, this requires the reconstruction of metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) from sequencing reads. We present the nf-core/mag pipeline for metagenome assembly, binning and taxonomic classification. It can optionally combine short and long reads to increase assembly continuity and utilize sample-wise group-information for co-assembly and genome binning. The pipeline is easy to install-all dependencies are provided within containers-portable and reproducible. It is written in Nextflow and developed as part of the nf-core initiative for best-practice pipeline development. All codes are hosted on GitHub under the nf-core organization https://github.com/nf-core/mag and released under the MIT license.},

    abstract = {With a large number of metagenomic datasets becoming available, eukaryotic metagenomics emerged as a new challenge. The proper classification of eukaryotic nuclear and organellar genomes is an essential step toward a better understanding of eukaryotic diversity.We developed Tiara, a deep-learning-based approach for the identification of eukaryotic sequences in the metagenomic datasets. Its two-step classification process enables the classification of nuclear and organellar eukaryotic fractions and subsequently divides organellar sequences into plastidial and mitochondrial. Using the test dataset, we have shown that Tiara performed similarly to EukRep for prokaryotes classification and outperformed it for eukaryotes classification with lower calculation time. In the tests on the real data, Tiara performed better than EukRep in analyzing the small dataset representing eukaryotic cell microbiome and large dataset from the pelagic zone of oceans. Tiara is also the only available tool correctly classifying organellar sequences, which was confirmed by the recovery of nearly complete plastid and mitochondrial genomes from the test data and real metagenomic data.Tiara is implemented in python 3.8, available at https://github.com/ibe-uw/tiara and tested on Unix-based systems. It is released under an open-source MIT license and documentation is available at https://ibe-uw.github.io/tiara. Version 1.0.1 of Tiara has been used for all benchmarks.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},
